 * Consider Dijkstra's original description of the nature of the problem:
 * 
 * "Find the path of minimum total length between two given nodes P￼ and
 * Q￼.
 * 
 * "We use the fact that, if R￼ is a node on the minimal path from P￼ to
 * Q￼, knowledge of the latter implies the knowledge of the minimal path
 * from P￼ to R￼."
